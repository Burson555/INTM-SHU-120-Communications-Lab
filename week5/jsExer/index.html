<!-- Here are some tips for solving the exercise. It is helpful to fully complete each step before moving on to the next.

1) Create the HTML file. This should show the button and the three images in an unstyled way.

2) Create the CSS file and use flex box to position the images next to each other. Keep in mind that an image cannot be used directly inside a flex box container, so you need to wrap each image in a <div>.

3) Link the button to a JavaScript function. This function should increment a number variable, which keeps track of which image is currently active. Based on the number variable, you should use a if/else statement to change the opacity of the <div> tags. Keep in mind that when the last image is active and the button is clicked, you will need to go back to the first image by resetting the number variable. -->
