Project Description

In groups of two, create a webpage that features audio collage. The audio should be the main focus of your page. The visuals and design should be in support of the audio.

The audio can be a single edited composition or numerous sounds or compositions collaged or sequenced through user interaction. You can use self-recorded or pre-recorded audio.

There must be intention and a concept. This piece could be environmental, musical, create space or mood, or tell a story through sound.

Create an audio project combining recorded audio and other sources at least 1 minute in length.
